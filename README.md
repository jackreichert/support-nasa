# Support NASA
A labor of love, space inspired web projects. View the project here  https://jackreichert.github.io/support-nasa/.

## What IS this project?
This was inspired by [@femmebot](https:/twitter.com/femmebot)'s project [HAND-PICKED TALES from ÆSOP’S FABLES with HAND-PICKED TYPE from GOOGLE FONTS](http://femmebot.github.io/google-type/). The goal here is to link two of my passions: space and web artistry.

Some of the [greatest technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_spinoff_technologies) have come out of NASA's mission to pioneer the future in space exploration, scientific discovery and aeronautics research. There has been no greater inspiration to mankind than by landing people on the moon, sending robots to other planets, and looking out to the edges of the universe.

The DONATE button donates directly to NASA, so this site is literally about donating back to NASA too.

This is my small way to give back.
